# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

- Resources
    - RStudio

## Overview

AutosRUs is producing a new prototype vehicle for market.  They are experiencing production problems blocking their progress.  This analysis is to assist them in discovering insights that may help manufacturing.

## Objectives

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Outcomes

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Two variables, vehicle_length and ground_clearance, with their resulting p-values show that they are statistically unlikely to be providing random amounts of variance to the linear model and therefore have a significant impact on miles per galon. This evidence for influential linear relationships, together with our overall p-value below the 5% significance level, results in a non-zero slope for our model.

- Furthermore, with an overall r-squared value of 0.7149, the linear model predicts mpg of MechaChar prototypes effectively.

PSI statistic summary

Statistic summary grouped by Lot
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  Lot3 does not meet these specificatioins.
- The results show that Lot1 is the best performer of the group with lower statistical spread in it's distribution of measured PSI. Lot2 is still well within the acceptable limits of statistical variation and therefore acceptable as well.

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Using the Suspension Coil data
1. Determind if the PSI adcross all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

- Note the p-value is above the significance level of .05 whcih indicates we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the two means are indeed statistically similar.

2. Perform t-test to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing Lot is statistically different from the populatioin mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

**Lot1**

The p-value here is exactly 1 which indicates that the sample from Lot1 is statistically similar to the population mean.  

**Lot2**
![Screen Shot 2022-07-01 at 1 40 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100544761/176953168-30c889d5-b9d5-4cf9-8984-166ec7eec3e8.png)

The p-value of 0.6072 indicates that there is not enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis, and the two samples are indeed statistically similar.

**Lot3**
![Screen Shot 2022-07-01 at 1 40 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100544761/176953313-18097701-3d83-4f11-82cf-ab0d08a03e42.png)

The p-value of 0.04168 suggests that we can refute the null hypothesis that the two are statistically similar and accept that there are differences between the two observed sample means.
